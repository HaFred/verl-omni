"""Reward function for the Bagel Co-RL (Joint-Training) in-loop RM payload (RFC §4.2).

Wire as the custom reward function of the colocated RM pool — the SAME handles
serve mid-loop GEN scoring and post-hoc episode scoring, so ``compute_score``
dispatches on payload shape::

    reward.custom_reward_function.path=pkg://verl_omni.utils.reward_score.bagel_rm_image_scorer
    reward.custom_reward_function.name=compute_score

Call contract (this is what the configured manager actually does)
----------------------------------------------------------------
``RewardLoopWorker.compute_score(data)`` → ``reward_manager.run_single(data)``.
``NaiveRewardManager`` (the repo default) reads ``data_source`` /
``reward_model["ground_truth"]`` and calls the reward function with exactly four
keywords — ``data_source``, ``solution_str``, ``ground_truth``, ``extra_info``
(``VisualRewardManager`` passes ``solution_image`` instead), and merges the
returned dict's keys into ``reward_extra_info``. A reward function that takes a
single positional ``data`` therefore fails with ``TypeError``/``KeyError``; so
does one that returns ``reward_score`` instead of ``score``.

The payload must ride a key the manager already forwards. ``extra_info`` is that
key: the in-loop builder
(``verl_omni.agent_loop.bagel_corl_rm._default_data_builder``) puts the payload
under ``extra_info["bagel_corl"]``.

- Mid-loop (``verl_omni.agent_loop.bagel_corl_rm.build_rm_score_payload``): each
  image is judged (C/A via the frozen VL judge) and the result carries per-image
  ``sample_scores`` / ``sample_good_enough`` aligned to ``image_paths`` — exactly
  what ``parse_rm_result`` consumes off ``reward_extra_info``.
- Episode post-hoc (no payload): delegated to
  ``agentic_multidim_reward.compute_score`` (image-grounded when ``K >= 1``,
  multi-dim RPCO when ``K = 0``) — the authoritative token-GRPO scalar.

Fails loud when any image cannot be scored (missing file, empty judge URL, parse
failure): a silently-unscored GEN call would zero FlowGRPO signal for that group.
