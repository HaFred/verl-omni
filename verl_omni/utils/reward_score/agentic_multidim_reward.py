"""RPCO multi-dimensional reward for agentic image-generation trajectories.

The scorer is intentionally self-contained so the reward PR can be reviewed
and merged independently of RFC #302's rollout and data PRs. It accepts the
trajectory text emitted by those PRs once they are present, but does not import
their agent-loop or dataset modules.

Wire with ``reward.reward_manager.name=naive`` so verl passes ``solution_str``.
``VisualRewardManager``'s ``solution_image`` is the wrong modality and raises.

The active reward set is ``{reflect, plan, format, tool, result}``. ``plan`` is
active only for plan rows. ``done`` and ``tool_call`` reproduce the PR1
closed-loop indicators for metrics, but are not additional score dimensions.
Invalid rollouts (no parsed ``generate_image`` call or no successful PNG)
receive score zero and ``rollout_valid=0``. ``task_type`` is required.

Judge C/A is trusted only after a parsed ``judge_image`` ``<tool_call>`` and the
tool observation header. Coverage is token F1 (not recall-only), so dumping
reference words into a long blob does not max ``R_reflect`` / ``R_plan``.
Rewrite-after-YES zeros ``R_result`` as well as the Done indicator. Reflect
``R_result`` requires a terminal trusted YES. ``R_tool`` needs a successful
PNG generate plus a trusted judge (not merely a parsed tool call).

The Bagel Co-RL (Joint-Training) loop is the second producer of this reward and
speaks a different observation dialect: calls ride ``<tools>{...}</tools>``, a
generated image is announced as a bare ``path=<abs>.png``, and the in-loop RM
verdict arrives paraphrased in the forced ``Reflection: VL judge reports ...``
line instead of an ``agentic_judge ok=1`` observation. ``_normalize_trajectory_dialect``
maps the lexical differences and ``_bagel_judge_hits`` reads the verdict, gated on
the ``generate_image`` call it is attributable to. Both are inert on a Hermes
transcript.
