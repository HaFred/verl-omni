"""One classifier for the rollout engine's transient sleep-mode VRAM failure.

A rollout wake re-maps the memory the engine backed up during its level-1 sleep, and it does so
through vLLM's sleep-mode allocator (``cuMemCreate``/``cuMemMap``; see ``cumem_allocator.cpp``).
That call needs a large *physically contiguous* region, so on a card shared with another tenant it
can fail even when the free total is ample, and the engine reports it as::

    Wake-up failed on Rank 0: CUDA Error: out of memory at /workspace/csrc/cumem_allocator.cpp:163

(measured 2026-09-25 00:21:42 on hk01dgx039, devices 0/1/6/7, ``bagel_corl_rm1_20260925_000612``:
device 0 carried 28.66GiB of a *neighbouring* job while our actor shard reserved 8.57GiB, so
~41GiB was free against a ~14GiB TP=2 re-map and the create still failed).

This module is a leaf on purpose -- it imports nothing from ``verl_omni`` -- because two layers
need the same judgement and neither can import the other:

* :mod:`verl_omni.workers.engine_workers` retries the ``update_weights`` resume path, flushing the
  *actor's* cached blocks between attempts (``_resume_rollout_vram_safe``).
* :mod:`verl_omni.workers.rollout.vllm_rollout.vllm_omni_async_server` must retry *itself*, because
  ``wake_up`` is also reached directly by the trainer (``BagelCoRLTrainer._wake_rollout_replicas``)
  with no caller-side retry at all. That gap is what killed
  ``bagel_corl_rm1_20260927_165227`` at 18:11 after 41 healthy steps, from
  ``engine_workers._resume_rollout_vram_safe``'s point of view an unreachable path.

Retrying is safe because a *failed* wake samples nothing -- the weights are still in the CPU backup
and the engine stays asleep -- so re-issuing the same request is idempotent.
