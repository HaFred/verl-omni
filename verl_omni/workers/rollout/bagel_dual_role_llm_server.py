# Measured 2026-09-20 18:42:58 on hk01dgx039: the first training rollout of a
# fresh AR replica submitted four UND decodes; two reached the AR engine and never
# came back. ``LLMServerClient.generate`` awaits ``server.generate.remote(...)``
# with no timeout, and the AR strategy drains the engine generator with
# ``_collect_last_output`` -- which only returns once the orchestrator delivers a
# terminal output for the request. So a request the engine admits and never
# finishes parks a whole episode (and its ``TaskRunnerV1`` step) forever:
#
#   * the agent loop logged ``bagel_dual_role_generate route=und`` for each of the
#     four decodes at 18:42:58 / 18:43:01 and no matching ``bagel_dual_role_done``;
#   * ``ray.util.state.list_tasks`` still showed two RUNNING
#     ``vLLMOmniHttpServer.generate`` tasks 15 minutes later;
#   * the AR actor answered an independent probe ``generate`` in 0.2 s and its AR
#     worker held ~33% SM the whole time, so the engine was *alive* -- this is a
#     request-lifecycle stall, not a dead engine;
#   * ``server.abort_all_requests()`` on that actor reported
#     ``{'aborted_count': 2, ...}``, i.e. the two calls had been admitted and their
#     ``request_states`` entries had never retired.
#
# ``BAGEL_CORL_DECODE_TIMEOUT_S`` (default 600, 0 disables) bounds that await.
# ``BAGEL_CORL_DECODE_HEARTBEAT_S`` (default 30) logs a warning while a decode is
# still outstanding, so a stall is visible with timestamps instead of silent.
# On expiry the lane's engine is aborted *and resumed* (``abort_all_requests``
# pauses admission, ``resume_generation`` lifts it) and the decode is re-issued
# ``BAGEL_CORL_DECODE_MAX_RECOVERIES`` times (default 1) -- new requests served
# after such an abort complete normally, so the retry keeps a long run alive
# instead of failing the step. Aborts are reported at ERROR level with the
# engine-reported in-flight count, which is the one number that separates
# "admitted but never finished" (engine side) from "never reached the engine"
# (client/balancer side).
